# Northcoders News API

Project Overview

Northcoders News API is a RESTful API designed to provide programmatic access to application data, mimicking a real-world backend service like Reddit. The API serves data from a PostgreSQL database and is built using Node.js and Express.js, with database interactions managed via node-postgres.

This project is intended for developers who want to retrieve and interact with structured news-related data via API endpoints.

Getting Started
1. Cloning the Repository
To set up the project locally, first clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Chijideofor12/BackEnd-NC-News
cd <your-repo-name>


2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required Node.js packages:

npm install

 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Since .env.* files are ignored by version control (.gitignore), you need to create them manually to run the project locally.

Create two .env files in the root directory:

.env.development
.env.test
Add the following lines to the respective files, replacing <database_name> with the actual database names:

PGDATABASE=<database_name>

Example:

For development:

PGDATABASE=<database_name>

For Testing:

PGDATABASE=<database_name_test>

Save the files. These environment variables will allow the application to connect to the correct databases.

Note: Ensure the database names match those defined in your config or db setup files.

4. Set Up the Database
Run the following command to create and seed the database:

npm run setup-dbs
npm run seed

5. Running Tests
To ensure everything is working correctly, run the test suite:

npm test

Running the Server Locally

Start the local development server with:

npm start

The server should now be running on http://localhost:9090/api.


Minimum Requirements
To run this project, you need:

Node.js: v18+
PostgreSQL: v14+
Ensure you have these installed before proceeding.
